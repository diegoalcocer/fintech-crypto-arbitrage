# ðŸ’¹ Fintech | Crypto Arbitrage

As **Bitcoin** trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of *Pandas*? In this repository we will analyze the historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase and determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

## Technologies

This analysis is implemented on the web-based interactive computer platform [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using *Python* and **Pandas**.

## Usage

Clone the app from this repository to start using it.

ðŸ“‚ In the folder called resources, you will find two files, with historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp (**bitstamp.csv**) and Coinbase (**coinbase.csv**)

ðŸ“… The data is in the date range: **2018-01-01** to **2018-03-31**

ðŸ“š This project uses the following libraries to analyze and plot the data:
* Pandas
* Pathlib
* matplotlib

For analysis purposes the data will be analized in 3 dates:
* An early date
* A middle date
* A late date

To make a decision, the data is plotted, the **arbitrage spread** is calculated and the profitable trades are obtained. The total *profit* for each date and the cumulative profit (*cumsum*). The notebook is fully commented to guide you step by step in the analysis
